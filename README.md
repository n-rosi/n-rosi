👋 Hi, I’m @n-rosi, many people call me Niky. 

💞️ My main interests are Computer Science, Wind Energy and Physics. Additionally, I would love to deepen the world of Quantum Computing in my future. 

🌱 One of my present challeng consists of learning how to train large neural network models on HPCs with multiple CPUs, I would be enthusiastic to open discussions on this topic!
