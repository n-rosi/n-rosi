👋 Hi, I’m @n-rosi, many people call me Niky. 

💞️ My main interests are Machine Learning and Advanced Computational Methods. 

🌱 One of my present challeng consists of training a purely Physics Informed Neural Network to solve the Fokker-Planck equation, I would be enthusiastic to open discussions on this topic!
