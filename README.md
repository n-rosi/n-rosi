👋 Hi, I’m @n-rosi, but you can call me Niky!
✨ I’m interested in Computer Science, Renewable Energy and Particle Physics, but I would also like to extend my interests to Quantum Computing soon.
🌱 I’m currently learning how to perform distributed training of Deep Neuarl Networks on HPC (multiple CPUs).  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects regarding Renewable Energy digitalization and Machine Lerning in general.
