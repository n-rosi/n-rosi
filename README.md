👋 Hi, I’m @n-rosi, many people call me Niky. 

💞️ My main interests are Computer Science, Wind Energy and Physics. Additionally, I would love to deepen the world of Quantum Computing in my future. 

🌱 In my current activity, I am learning how to perform distributed training of Deep Neuarl Networks on HPC (multiple CPUs) and I would be very happy to open discussions on this topic.
